* What is this?

It's a gentoo overlay by [[/etu][Etu]] and [[/adisbladis][Adisbladis]].


* And it contains...?

Some random stuff, plz look around.


* How to add it to my system?

Merge layman (with git enabled ofc), edit the file: =/etc/layman/layman.cfg=

And add =https://github.com/etu/aidstu-overlay/raw/master/overlay.xml= to the =overlays:= part.

So it looks like this...
:overlays  : http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/overlays/repositories.xml
:	https://github.com/etu/aidstu-overlay/raw/master/overlay.xml

And then just...
:# layman -L
:# layman -a aidstu

And make sure to have this at the end of your /etc/make.conf:
:# source /var/lib/layman/make.conf
